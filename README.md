# Discord Speed Meet Up Bot

Feel free to fork this repo and work on it! Sadly, I have currently not enough time to complete the project.

## Issues until now

- Initialize waitingroom at bot initialization (current workaround: initialize bot with one command only executable by admin.)

- [NOT IMPLEMENTED] Check how many people are in a room and open a new one if a certain number is exceeded.

- Reorder people after a certain time
